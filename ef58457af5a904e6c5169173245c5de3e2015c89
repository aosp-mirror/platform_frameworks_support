      "message": "Do you have an example of a bad timing window?\n\nI currently feel this is enough because:\n1. We wrap the given suspend block waiting for all child coroutines before we release the transaction thread.\n2. We don\u0027t support very bad scenarios created by developer errors (GlobalScope.launch, other deferred DAOs).\n3. As other dispatchers, we don\u0027t support being leaked outside the coroutine scope, hence rejecting once released is a sane action.\n\nKeep in mind that the design of this API is to re-route DB operations into this transaction thread, serially, but similar to the Android SQL bindings, block other DB operations outside of the coroutine scope while the transaction is on-going.",
