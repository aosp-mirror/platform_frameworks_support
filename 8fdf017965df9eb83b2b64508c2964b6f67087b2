That would require even less, but maybe that\u0027s too inflexible?\n\nYes, I had the same thought when I got the previous comments from Nate and you about further simplification.\n\nAlthough having just one authority for both resources and assets or at least hosting all assets under one path looks simpler (some thing analogous to file:///android_res/..., file:///android_asset/...), I think enabling the developer to host only a sub-directory of assets folder or hosting assets on multiple domains/authorities (as the current api offers) looks like a nice thing to have. They are wired use-cases but I think it\u0027s nice to have. WDYT?",
