      "message": "Is there a reason we need this requirement at all? Elsewhere we just allow them to be independent, I believe.\n\nThe following scenario seems possible to me: a nav app with a relatively thin client, which just renders images it receives from the server. In that case such a nav app would not be able to send any lane information at all, since it wouldn\u0027t have the metadata.",

      "message": "To me that would be a dangerous path: if we allow images without metadata, then we should just remove metadata altogether, as OEMs wouldn\u0027t be able to reliably trust they will receive it.\nIn order words: if an OEM assumes they will receive lane configuration metadata (because the API describes it), and they develop a cluster implementation that relies on it, it would be very bad if a particular app doesn\u0027t provide it. \n\nIn my opinion, it is already cuestionable that we are providing lanes configuration image at all (I don\u0027t think images will be flexible enough to accommodate all possible OEM implementations). I believe we should consider them as only an auxiliary option (to fulfill the short term requirements), but not the main way to communicate data between apps and clusters.",

They already have to support no lane guidance at all, so it\u0027s trivial to also support image-with-no-metadata.\n\nTo me we\u0027re basically providing two APIs here: an image API (for consumers that want to use images consistent with the producer, or who don\u0027t want to make their own) and a metadata API (for consumers that want to use their own images, or can\u0027t use images for technical reasons).
